# 42 Cursus - C++ Module 06
# Description
C++ Module 06 at School 42 introduces type conversion, dynamic casting, and the use of runtime type identification (RTTI) in polymorphic class hierarchies. This module is an essential step toward mastering safe downcasting and understanding the internal type mechanics of C++.

# Topics Covered
Static and Dynamic Casts: Learn when and how to use static_cast, dynamic_cast, reinterpret_cast, and const_cast.
RTTI (Run-Time Type Information): Use typeid and dynamic_cast to identify object types at runtime.
Safe Downcasting: Use base class pointers to call derived class methods safely.
Polymorphism: Rely on virtual functions to ensure correct object behavior.
Abstract Base Classes: Utilize interfaces and pure virtual methods to enable polymorphic behavior.

📌 Exercise 00 - Conversion of scalar types
Create a non-instantiable ScalarConverter class with a static convert() method that takes a string literal and prints its representation as char, int, float, and double. Handle special cases like non-displayable chars and pseudo-literals (nan, inf, etc.) appropriately.

📌 Exercise 01 - Serialization
Create a non-instantiable Serializer class with two static methods: serialize() to convert a Data* to a uintptr_t, and deserialize() to convert it back. Test by verifying that deserializing a serialized pointer returns the original Data object.

📌 Exercise 01 - Identify real type
Create a Base class with a virtual destructor and three derived classes A, B, and C. Implement generate() to randomly return a Base* to one of them, and use overloaded identify() functions (one with pointer, one with reference) to detect and print the actual type—without using typeid or .

# Conclusion
Module 06 helps you master RTTI and safe type conversion techniques in C++. These tools are essential when working with polymorphic class hierarchies, ensuring that your casts and type checks are safe, meaningful, and efficient.
