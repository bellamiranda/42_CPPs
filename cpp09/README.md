# 42 Cursus - C++ Module 09
# Description
C++ Module 09 at School 42 focuses on sequence containers, template specialization, and performance-oriented programming using standard containers like list and deque. The module emphasizes parsing, sorting, and evaluating performance between different container types.

# Topics Covered
Container Comparison: Understanding the differences between std::list and std::deque.
Parsing Inputs: Safely parse and validate command-line arguments.
Template Programming: Create container-agnostic functions and classes.
Performance Measurement: Use timing utilities to evaluate algorithm efficiency.
Sorting Algorithms: Implement efficient sorting techniques on different containers.
STL Integration: Practice STL usage in realistic applications.

📌 Exercise 00- Bitcoin Exchange
Create a program btc that reads a file of dates and values, multiplies each value by the closest (lower or equal) bitcoin price from a CSV database, and prints the result. Used a std::map to store and efficiently retrieve bitcoin prices by date, handling invalid inputs, formatting errors, and edge cases with appropriate messages.

📌 Exercise 01 - Reverse Polish Notation
Create a program RPN that takes a Reverse Polish Notation expression as input, processes it using a std::stack to evaluate the result, and prints the final value. Operands (0–9) and operators (+, -, *, /) are pushed and processed using stack logic; errors like invalid input or malformed expressions are reported via standard error.

📌 Exercise 02 - PmergeMe
Create a program PmergeMe that takes a sequence of positive integers as input (via command-line arguments), parses them, and sorts them using both std::deque and std::list.

Key Features:
Validate inputs (positive integers only).
Store data in both std::deque and std::list.
Sort both containers using a custom merge-insert algorithm.
Measure and print the time taken by each container to perform the sort.
Compare the results and performance between the two.

# Conclusion
Module 09 brings together your C++ skills to solve a performance-sensitive problem with STL containers and algorithms. Understanding how different containers behave under the same operations is crucial for writing optimized and scalable applications.
