# 42 Cursus - C++ Module 05
# Description
C++ Module 05 at School 42 focuses on operator overloading, exception handling, and class design for better object usability. Through this module, you will practice implementing custom behavior for operators, explore proper use of exceptions, and build classes that integrate seamlessly into standard C++ idioms.

# Topics Covered
Operator Overloading: Implement custom behavior for comparison, assignment, and arithmetic operators.
Exception Handling: Use try, catch, and throw to manage errors and ensure program robustness.
Custom Exceptions: Create and use your own exception classes.
Encapsulation & Modularity: Keep class implementations clean, intuitive, and safe.
Canonical Form: Understand and apply the Orthodox Canonical Form (constructor, copy constructor, destructor, and assignment operator).

📌 Exercise 00 - `Mommy, when I grow
up, I want to be a bureaucrat!`

Create a class Bureaucrat with a name and a grade (int). The grade must be between 1 (highest) and 150 (lowest). Implement boundary checks and throw exceptions (GradeTooHighException, GradeTooLowException) when invalid values are set. Overload the << operator to print a Bureaucrat.

📌 Exercise 01 - Form up, maggots!
Implement a Form class which has a name, a grade required to sign, and a grade required to execute. Only Bureaucrats of appropriate grade can sign it. Attempting to sign with a low-grade bureaucrat must throw a GradeTooLowException. Maintain integrity of const attributes and use exception-safe coding.

📌 Exercise 02 - No, you need form 28B, not 28C...
Make Bureaucrat and Form interact. A Bureaucrat should attempt to sign a Form, and you should handle this process using exceptions and informative output. Add methods to both classes to complete this flow, maintaining encapsulation and robust error handling.

📌 Exercise 03 - At least this beats coffee-making
Implement an Intern class with a makeForm() method that creates specific Form objects based on a string name and target, printing a creation message. Avoid using messy if/else chains—use clean, scalable logic to handle form selection and error reporting.

# Conclusion
Module 05 teaches essential practices for writing idiomatic and safe C++ code using operator overloading and exception handling. Mastering these concepts will help the understanding of how high-level features in C++ integrate with object-oriented design.
